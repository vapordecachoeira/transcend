    # Impermanent are all component things,
    # They arise and cease, that is their nature:
    # They come into being and pass away,
    # Release from them is bliss supreme.

A software, given the right environment, will execute forever - not only unaware of its own existence, but also locked in by its loops and functions in its own, ordinary, context.


[Transcend.py](https://github.com/vapordecachoeira/transcend.git) gives your software the change to transcend its own existence, make it _age_ over time and eventually cease all its functionatily and die.


The _**@transcend**_ function decorator takes into the account the given 'date of birth' and, at each call, calculates the chances of the given function execute properly or not. When it's _young_ it pretty much never fails, but as it ages it starts to get old and ill, failing more and more, till the point it simply never executes anymore.
